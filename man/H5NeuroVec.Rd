\title{H5NeuroVec Constructor}
\usage{
H5NeuroVec(file_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_name}{The path to an existing 4D HDF5 neuroimaging file.}
}
\value{
A new \code{\link{H5NeuroVec-class}} instance with an open HDF5 file handle.
}
\description{
Constructs an \code{\link{H5NeuroVec}} object, which represents a 4D brain image
stored in an HDF5 file. The HDF5 file is opened in read-only mode.
}
\details{
This constructor is used for reading existing HDF5 files that conform
to the H5NeuroVec specification (typically created via \code{as_h5("NeuroVec", ...)}).
}
\section{Lifecycle Management}{

When an \code{H5NeuroVec} object is created by providing a \code{file_name},
it opens the specified HDF5 file and maintains an open handle to it.
**It is the user's responsibility to explicitly close this handle** when the
object is no longer needed to release system resources. This can be done by calling
\code{close(your_h5neurovec_object)}.

Failure to close the handle may lead to issues such as reaching file handle
limits or problems with subsequent access to the file.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming "my_vec.h5" is a valid H5NeuroVec HDF5 file
h5vec <- H5NeuroVec("my_vec.h5")
# ... perform operations with h5vec ...
print(dim(h5vec))
# Important: Close the handle when done
close(h5vec)
}
