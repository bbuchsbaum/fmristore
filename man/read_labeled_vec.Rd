\title{Read a Labeled Neuroimaging Volume Set from HDF5}
\usage{
read_labeled_vec(file_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{Character string: path to the HDF5 file.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{LabeledVolumeSet-class}} object with an open HDF5 file handle.
}
\description{
Reads an HDF5 file, typically one previously created by
\code{\link{write_labeled_vec}} (now deprecated), and constructs a
\code{\link{LabeledVolumeSet-class}} object.
The HDF5 file is opened in read-only mode.
}
\details{
This function is the primary way to load data into a \code{LabeledVolumeSet}
from its HDF5 disk representation. The structure of the HDF5 file is expected
to follow the specification laid out by \code{write_labeled_vec}.
}
\section{Lifecycle Management}{

When a \code{LabeledVolumeSet} object is created by this function,
it opens the specified HDF5 file and the returned object takes ownership of
this open file handle.
**It is the user's responsibility to explicitly close this handle** when the
object is no longer needed to release system resources. This can be done by calling
\code{close(your_labeled_volume_set_object)}.

Failure to close the handle may lead to issues such as reaching file handle
limits or problems with subsequent access to the file.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming "my_labeled_set.h5" is a valid HDF5 file for LabeledVolumeSet
lvs <- read_labeled_vec("my_labeled_set.h5")
# ... perform operations with lvs ...
print(dim(lvs))
print(labels(lvs))
# Important: Close the handle when done
close(lvs)
}
}

\code{\link{write_labeled_vec}} for the (deprecated) writing function,
\code{\link{LabeledVolumeSet-class}} for details on the object structure,
\code{\link{close}} for closing the file handle.
