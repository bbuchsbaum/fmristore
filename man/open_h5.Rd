\title{Open an HDF5 file or use an existing handle}
\usage{
open_h5(src, mode = "r")
}
\arguments{
\item{src}{A character string path to an HDF5 file or an existing `H5File` object.}

\item{mode}{The mode to open the file in (e.g., "r", "r+", "w"). Defaults to "r".}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
  - `h5`: The `H5File` object handle.
  - `owns`: A logical flag, `TRUE` if the function opened the file (src was a path),
            `FALSE` otherwise (src was already an `H5File` object).
}
\description{
Handles the boilerplate of checking if the input is a file path or an
existing H5File object, opening the file if necessary, and returning
a list containing the handle and a flag indicating ownership (whether
the function opened the file and is responsible for closing it).
