\title{H5NeuroVol Constructor}
\usage{
H5NeuroVol(file_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_name}{A \code{character} string giving the path to an existing 3D HDF5 neuroimaging file.}
}
\value{
A new \code{\link{H5NeuroVol-class}} instance with an open HDF5 file handle.
}
\description{
Constructs an \code{\link{H5NeuroVol}} object representing a 3D brain volume
stored in an HDF5 file. The HDF5 file is opened in read-only mode.
}
\details{
This constructor is typically used for reading existing HDF5 files that conform
to the H5NeuroVol specification.
}
\section{Lifecycle Management}{

When an \code{H5NeuroVol} object is created by providing a \code{file_name},
it opens the specified HDF5 file and maintains an open handle to it.
**It is the user's responsibility to explicitly close this handle** when the
object is no longer needed to release system resources. This can be done by calling
\code{close(your_h5neurovol_object)}.

As a safety net, a finalizer is registered on the internal HDF5 handle so
it will be closed if the object is garbage collected. Explicitly calling
\code{close()} is still recommended.

Failure to close the handle may lead to issues such as reaching file handle
limits or problems with subsequent access to the file.

\dontrun{
# Assuming "my_volume.h5" is a valid H5NeuroVol HDF5 file
h5vol <- H5NeuroVol("my_volume.h5")
# ... perform operations with h5vol ...
print(dim(h5vol))
# Important: Close the handle when done
close(h5vol)
}
